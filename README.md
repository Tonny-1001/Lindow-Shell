# Lindow-Shell
Windows shell that allows you to use linux commands.

(This is not a real shell! It was created for fun.)

## How to use it?
Download installer [here](https://github.com/Tonny-1001/Lindow-Shell/releases), install it wherever you want, done!
Now you can just run it but i suggest adding new profile that uses Lindow executable in [Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=pl-pl&gl=pl) app.
